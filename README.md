## General info

This was developed as part of SEI 34 for my final project, the goal was to build a web application from scratch, to show off what I have learned over my short, yet intense three month 'coding-bootcamp' at General Assembly. The type of web application I chose to create was completely up to me as well as the tech stack.

5. `npm run dev` on both to run the app

You can see the site [here](). //TODO: deploy app

## Code Examples

What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a type-safe query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It's a replacement for (or addition to) your REST API and Ajax Calls.

GraphQL requires buy-in from both your client and your server â€” it then puts the power of requesting only what you want into the client and the business logic of finding and filtering that data into backend resolvers.

`query getSomeData { users { name email cart { activity { title description price } } } }`

## Features

- Full stack online store complete with real credit checkout
- Users can add to cart and checkout, and view their past orders
- JWT authentication, uploading images using cloudinary, and charging credit cards using stripe

To-do list:
